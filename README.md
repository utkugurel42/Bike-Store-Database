# Bike-Store-Database
A relational database of a 3 different bike stores in New York,California and Texas.
I've utilized fundamental aspects of SQL programming language in this project. (Data cleaning,data wrangling,storing and grouping values)
For a holistic data analysis I managed to extract various questions from the data I have.

Note: Since this data contains 9 individual tables(brands,categories,customers,order_items,orders,products,staffs,stocks,stores) checking all of them for Null and Duplicate values took a little space at the beginning. Please be patient and scroll down to see the questions I came up with for this data analysis project.
I also shared my insights and recommendations from my analysis.
