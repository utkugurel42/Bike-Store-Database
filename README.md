# Bike-Store-Database
A relational database of a 3 different bike store in New York,California and Texas.
I've utilized fundamental aspects of SQL programming language in this project. (Data cleaning,data wrangling,storing and grouping values)
For a holistic data analysis I managed to extract various questions from the data I have.
